#Leboncoin Scraper
I was given a file of raw html that my team-members needed to collect real-estate data from to feed into an ml model that would predict turnover. I parsed and serialized the data as well as made a loading program to allow the team to access it easily: https://github.com/pstringe/leboncoin
